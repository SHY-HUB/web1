  2. etymology[edit]
  At first, in front of the office Gosling oak built in a ttawa OAK it is still registered as a trademark hagien having problems,[1] The consultant took an extreme approach, trapping the developers in the boardroom in the afternoon and (...) brainstorming . Through associations such as "How do you feel" (Excited!) And "What makes you feel good?" (Java coffee!), I decided on several names and chose Java for Java coffee . Java is fourth in the ranking. The first name on the list was Silk, and Gosling's favorite name was Lyrics.

  Some say it was because the developers liked Java coffee. Icon shaped like a coffee mug. Or the name of the developer J the Ames Gosling, amps rthur V an Hoff, amps and Leading characters that quoted ndy Bechtolsheim heading in, and I was just pyeolchyeot Leading the advance came in the name of the eyes. But it's a big hit for what we've just built , and now Sun's symbol, as Sun has changed its NASDAQ code from SUNW to JAVA,But the sun was taken over by Oracle and disappearedIt became a word well known all over the world. source
