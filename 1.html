HTML is written in the form of an HTML element that is a "tag" surrounded by angle brackets within the web page content. HTML can include or load scripts such as JavaScript that affect the behavior of HTML processing devices, such as web browsers, and CSS that define the appearance and placement of text and other items.<p>
